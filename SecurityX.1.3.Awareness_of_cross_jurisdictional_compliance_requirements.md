Governance, Risk, and Compliance

1.3 Explain how compliance affects information security strategies.

## e-discovery

the process of discovering, preserving, and producing electronic data for legal proceedings or internal investigations. This involves identifying, collecting, and analyzing electronically stored information (ESI) such as emails, documents, audio recordings, images, videos, and other digital data. Steps include:

1.  Identification: Identifying relevant custodians and data sources
2. Preservation: Preserving evidence to prevent tampering or spoliation
3. Collection: Gathering electronic data from various sources (e.g., computers, servers, phones)
4. Processing: Sorting, filtering, and analyzing the collected data
5. Review: Manually reviewing data to identify relevant documents and metadata
6. Production: Producing the analyzed data in a legally acceptable format

## Legal holds

A Legal Hold is a notification issued by legal counsel to temporarily suspend normal business operations and preserve electronic evidence when there's a potential or actual legal dispute, lawsuit, or regulatory investigation. The hold aims to prevent the destruction, alteration, or concealment of relevant documents.

## Due diligence

Due Diligence is a thorough investigation or examination conducted by a party (typically the buyer) before entering into a transaction, agreement, or business arrangement with another party (the target). This involves gathering information about the target's business, finances, and legal status to assess its viability and potential risks.

## Due care

Due Care is a reasonable degree of attention, consideration, and prudence expected from an entity to prevent harm or injury to itself or others. It involves exercising caution and foresight in decision-making processes.

## Export controls

Export Controls refer to regulations governing the transfer, sale, or shipment of controlled goods, services, or technology outside a country's borders. These controls aim to protect national security, human rights, and economic interests by regulating exports.

### Key aspects of Export Controls:

1.  Classification of controlled items
2. Licensing requirements
3. Screening and vetting of customers and end-users
4. Compliance with regulations (e.g., EAR, ITAR)

## Contractual obligations

Contractual Obligations are specific responsibilities and expectations outlined in an agreement or contract between parties. These obligations ensure the mutual understanding of terms, conditions, and consequences for non-compliance.

### **Key components of Contractual Obligations:**

1.  Terms and conditions
2. Scope of work
3. Payment schedules
4. Performance metrics
5. Remedies for breach of contract
