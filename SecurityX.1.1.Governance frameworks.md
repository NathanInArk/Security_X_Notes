## Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)

Created by ISACA, COBIT is a framework for information technology. The goal of COBIT is regulatory compliance, rick management, and aligning IT with the organization's goals. COBIT has a wider approach and is not just a technical standard, the five key principles are:


- Meet the needs of the stakeholder
- Covers the enterprise end-to-end
- Apply single integrated framework.
- Enable holistic approach
- Separate Governance from Management

- IT governance systems that are well aligned with expectations and requirements of the stakeholders, so that value os generated. Value creation is possible by balancing resources, benefits, risk, governance system and actionable strategy.
- IT governance systems should not be made of a single component, but rather various components should be a part of it and they should be different from each other.
- It's better to use a dynamic governance systems so changes have no direct impact on the EGIT (IT Enterprise Governance). There should be no overlap between IT management and governance, both should be different and well serrated from each other.
- Governance specific systems must be well aligned with the needs of the concerned enterprise. This can be archived by pre-defining the customization and prioritizing the components used as a governance system
- Governance system has to be extensive enough to feature all of the IT functions, data and technology that an enterprise has to use to attain the set goals.
