CompTIA A+ 1102 Exam objectives list the change management process as the following:

- Request Forms
- Purpose of the Change
- Scope of the Change
- Date and time of the change
- Affected systems/impact
- Risk analysis
- Risk level
- Change board approval
- end-user acceptance

## Asset management life cycle

Asset management systems tracks assets throughout their lifespan. Managing and recording your assets makes it easier to confirm whether a vulnerability is or is not in you environment.

## Configuration management

Configuration management comprises a collection of actives focused on establishing and maintaining the integrity of product and systems. This is done though control of the process for initializing, changing and motoring the configurations of those products and systems.
Configuration Item is an identifiable part of a system that is a discrete target of a configuration control process.
Baseline configuration is a set of specifications for a system or CI that has been formally review and agreed on at a given point and time and which can only be changed thought change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds, releases and or changes.
If the configuration has to be changed to deviate from a baseline, the change should be exam and determine if the baseline needs to be updated to make the change, or if this is a one off occurrence.
Configuration Management plan is a comprehensive description of the roles, responsibility, policies and procedures that apply with managing the configuration of products and systems, it is made up for the following parts:

- Configuration Control Board, also known as change control board, a group of qualified people with responsibility for the process of controlling and proving changes throughout the development and operational lifecycle of products and systems.
- Configuration Item Identification, metrology for selecting and naming configuration items that need to be placed under the configuration management.
- configuration chance control, process for managing updates to the baseline confirmations for the items.
- configuration monitoring, process for assessing or testing the level of compliance against the established baseline.

Core Actives of Change management
Change Initiation:

- Identity the change requirements
- Risk assessment
- Priority for the change
- Documentation of the Request for Change

Change Review and Approval:

- Evaluating the Request for change for completeness
- Authorization path (who reviews the changes and authorizes them)
- Stakeholder reviews, resource identification and allocation
- Resource allocation
- Approvals or rejections
- Documentation fo approval or rejection

Implementation Evaluation

- Scheduling the change
- Testing it
- Verifying rollback procedures
- implementing it
- Evaluating it for proper and effective operation
- Documenting the change in the production environment

## database (CMDB)

 A Change management data base is a database that is used to store IT configurations and infrastructure information, the main purpose of the CMBD is to provide a single source of truth for an organizations changes, baselines, and configurations. This can include hardware, software, systems, facilities and even personal in some cases. The CMDB contains detailed information about each asset, including history, location, owner, function, and relationship to other assets. Each item inside of the database is a configuration item (CI)

## Inventory

An up to date record of all devices, licenses and assets in your organization. An up to date invetory is important for many reasons including:

- Strategic planning
- risk management
- resource optimization
- enhanced security
- compliance management
- lifecycle management
- disaster recovery
- enhanced user experience
- environmental responsibilities.
