Key splitting is a cryptography concept where you take the key and break it into smaller parts and distribute those partial keys. This can be used to require multiple people to decrypt data. A rough example of this is the famous Coke recipe that is stored to two separate vaults, to make the finished product it would require both partial recipes(keys)
