## Awareness and training

Users should be trained to know how to respond in various situations. Better user education enables a stronger security posture. Some organizations will adopt the "Prudent person rule" to ensure that training incorporates the procedures followed by others in the same field. If you are building out a user awareness and training plan start with a few questions such as. Does the program has the blessing of senior management? To borrow from the CISSP especially the think like a manager aspect, nothing happens with out a policy and policies are set by senior management. While we are borrowing, we can steal from ITIL, start where you are. What do you already have in place and do they dictate good security practices?

In a SANS blog post titled Seven Keys to Success for a more mature security Awareness Program, it identifies seven steps to take. Gain leadership support, create a security awareness advisory board, get specific on hwo your target groups are, identify and prioritize your human risk, communicate to and engage your target groups, update and improve, and measure.

### Phishing

Users should know how to identify phising attempt. Easy way to recognize a phising email is check the email's domain, address, sender information and the body of the email for anything suspicious. Some common red flags are emails that invoke urgency. Such as an email that says "Log in immediately", or "Click here now". Wire transfers and recipient of payments for things that the user did not request. Unusual grammar such as typos, grammatical errors, or tone/wording that clashes.

### Security

Security training should be a minium of a yearly occurrence, to help keep users up to date on the latest developments and risk. You can expect to cover how to better secure data, what tools are appropriate to use, how to report incidents. Steps end users can do to help mitigate risk.

### Social engineering

Social engineering can take many forms from phone based, vishing and smsishing, to in person attacks including tailgating, piggy backing, shoulder surfing, dumpster diving. Social engineers can also attack third party by convincing a phone company to do a sim swap and other attacks. Why does social engineering works? Social engineering attacks often prey on the human psyche by leveraging the need to obey an authority figure, implying scarcity, promoting a sense of urgency, or preying on fear. They also can use social proof, in which people will mirror the actions of others to appear more competent or cooperative and likeness, in which people who conform are more liked by the group.

### Privacy

End users should be trained on how to handle data. This can include company data or client data. Data handling will be determined based on how data is classified. If your company is subject to regulations then use those as the bare minium standard. A good place to start will be implementing data minimization, where you discourage the collection of excessive data or information not needed for a defined business activity. Purpose limitations, you should state why you are collecting data and only use it for the specified purpose.

### Operational security

Often abbreviated OPSEC, it's how to securely operate in an environment. There is five main steps in the OPSEC Process. Identify sensitive data, understand what your sensitive information might be. Threat Assessment, identify potential cybersecurity threat's, think of what adversaries cloud exploit about you. Vulnerability analysis, identify where you are vulnerable and or have a weakness in your security. Risk assessment, measure the level of risk to dow ith each previously identified vulnerability. Apply countermeasures, develope countermeasures to minimize the identified risk.

### Situational awareness

Situational awareness refers to an understanding of the cyber threat environment within which it operates, it's associated risk, impacts, and the adequacy of it's risk mitigation measures. This can be done with the OODA loop. The OODA loop is a four step approach to decisions making that focuses on filtering available information, putting it in context and quickly making the most appropriate decision while also understanding that changes can be made as more data becomes available It starts with Observe, gather data of your current environment and situation. Orient, analyze the data from the previous step. Decide, come up with a plan using insight from the last step. Then for the last step Act upon your plan. Due to it's loop nature the process can be repeated over and over until the situation is dealt with.

## Communication

User training should include training on proper communication channels, or ensure data says protected. If out of band communication is required, and who to direct questions and concerns to.

## Reporting

Training should cover how to report security incidents.

## Management commitment

Management buy in will be a big determining factor in the adoption of security practices. Buy in helps reduce the chance of them promoting bypasses and circumventing controls.
