Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

Risk assessment process tends to follow a few key steps. You start with asset identification, documenting what is in your network and what can be subject tto risk so you know what you are expected to protect. There is also information classification, where you label your information, labels can often be inferred from policies. There is two common classification systems the Government Classification System and the Commercial Classification System. The Government classification system starts at the top with Top Secret, any disclosure here would cause grave damage to national security. Then it go to the lower level of Secret, any disclosure would be expected to cause significate damage to national security, this include things like signification scientific, technological, operation and logistical information. The 2nd lowest level is Confidential. Anything with this label would cause damage to national security. Then at the bottom of the level is Unclassified, nothing here should be sensitive, but if aggregated with other unclassified documents, higher classified information can be deduced.
The Commercial information classification starts with Continental at the top as the most sensitive rating, anything at this level is required to keep the company competitive, it's release or alteration could seriously affect or damage the organization. THen it heads to Private, this includes restricted information that is considered personal in nature and might include HR information, or medical records. The 2nd lowest level is Sensitive, damage could result from it's lost of confidentiality or integrity. THe lowest level is Public, nothing here should cause damage, and is often published in government records, or on the company website.

## Quantitative vs. qualitative analysis

Quantitative assigns a cost or monetary value to the risk. To start you will need to determine the asset value, AV, for each asset, then determine threats to the asset and calculate the exposure factor, EF. Once you have the Asset Value and the Exposure Factor you can multiple them to get the Single Loss Expectancy, SLE. Now you need to figure how likely the risk is to be realized every year, this will be your Annualized Rate of Occurrence, ARO. Then you can get the final number, the Annualized Loss Expectancy, ALE, by multiplying the Annualized Rate of Occurrence and the Single Loss Expectancy.

Qualitative analysis ranks threats by none cost values, based more on intuition, experience and the scenario. Qualitative risk analysis focuses more on potential damages of things that are hard or impossible to put into dollar figures. You can divide the risk into three catagories such as Low, Medium, and High. Due to the subjective nature to helps to have your own definition of the catagories. To sort risk, rank them based on high, medium low, and how they impact the CIA triad. Once you have all of this information you can make a risk matrix based on the severity and how often they would occur to help you determine the qualitative risk.

## Risk assessment frameworks

To better help understand the risk and how to assign them values you can use a framework, there is three common ones mentioned in pervious CompTIA materials. ISAM, the infosec assessment Methodology which provides a framework for non government organizations, it ranks risk as critical, high, medium or low and helps determine the impact to the CIA triad.
Other options include the Delphi Technique, it is a group assessment that allows individuals to contribute the anonymous opinions and helps forecast the likelihood and outcomes of various events.
FRAP, fascinated risk assessment process is a subjective processes that ask a series of questions, designed to be a rather quick assessment.

## Appetite/tolerance

There is four outcomes when it comes to resolving risk. Avoid, in which you eliminate the risk. Accept, in which you have evaluated the risk and senior management is willing to accept the potential cost. Transfer, putting the ball of risk in someone else court, this can be with insurance. Mitigation, is when you use a control to reduce the risk.

When it comes to risk there is inherent, which is risk that is generated due to the nature of the action preformed, and residual, the left over risk after which precautions have been taken.

Which actions you take will be determined by your organization risk Appetite and tolerance. Which is simply how much risk is the company willing to expose itself to. This can vary based on the possible outcomes. The goal of Avoid, Transfer and Mitigation is to lower the level of residual risk to fit within the risk appetite of the company so that it can then be Accepted.

## Risk prioritization

Resources are rather limited compared to the amount of risk that might be in a company risk register. To combat this imbalance risk should be prioritized. Risk can be prioritized by severity, cost, regulatory or legal penalties, sensitivity, resource availability and manageability amongst others.

## Severity impact

Potential harm that might occur from exposure to risk, you can determine the severity of the impact by using a 5x5 risk matrix.

## Remediation

This is accomplished by mitigation, transference, and avoidance.

## Validation

I am unsure if this is talking about testing how valid your risk assessment process is, or more likely validating the controls used to reduce risk to an acceptable levels are working as intended. Controls can be physical, technical, or operational. Physical is self explaining but technical are tools such as VPN, firewalls, use of security protocols. Operational controls are stuff along the lines of hiring practices, security awareness training, and disaster response testing.
Some common controls are Mandatory Vacations, which help discover misuse of resources and fraud. Job Rotations, in which people swap job duties to ensure there is people with the skills to cover for others and helps reduce fraud. Dual control in which two people are required to work together to complete critical actions, think of two keys to open a vault. Separations of duties, in which an employee can only do so much and much have someone else do the remaining steps. Least privilege which is a concept that an employee should only have access to what is needed for the job, the opposite of privilege creep.
ALso be aware of Gap Analysis in which you compare where you are to where you should be, and audits in which policies and controls are reviewed.
