Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, implement the
appropriate governance components.

## Security program documentation

From the top down the policy structure is, according to other sources, Policy > Standards > Baseline > Guideline > Procedure. Baseline seems to be missing from the SecurityX objectives, but it is the minium level of security that a system, network, or device must adhere to. They can be mapped to industry standards.

### Policies

Policies are high level over view of security strategy or goals. Here you can find documents detailing how data is classified, type of access management in use. Expected user behavior with IT systems, and high level personnel security practices such as background checks. These are required to be followed and dictated by upper management.

### Procedures

More in depth than policies, breaks down how to do something step by step. They contain specific, repeatable steps. Staff should be able to located and execute procedures so they must be detailed enough to cover the task they support.

### Standards

Standards often come from legal, professional organizations or industry groups. Describes settings, expectations of performance, configurations and specific requirements. While standards will inform you on something that has to be done, it will not tell you how to do it or what changes to implement, that is determined by procedures. An example of this is a requirement that all email communication must be encrypted.

### Guidelines

Acts as recommendation or suggestion of how things should be done, often points to a statement in a policy or procedure to determine a course of action. Intended to be flexible so it can be customized for individual situations.
