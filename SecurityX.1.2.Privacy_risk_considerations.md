Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

## Data subject rights

Data Subject Rights refer to the set of rights granted to individuals (data subjects) by laws such as GDPR  (General Data Protection Regulation) and other regulations that regulate the handling of personal data.

These rights are designed to empower data subjects with control over their personal information and ensure that it is handled fairly, lawfully, and transparently. The main goals of Data Subject Rights are to:

Enhance Transparency: Require data controllers to be open and honest about how they collect and process personal data.
Empower Individuals: Provide individuals with the ability to make informed decisions about their personal data and exercise control over its processing.
Protect Fundamental Freedoms: Ensure that data subjects' fundamental freedoms, such as privacy, dignity, and autonomy, are protected.

The main Data Subject Rights include:

Right of Access: The right to obtain a copy of the personal data being processed.
Right to Rectification: The right to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten): The right to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances, such as when it's no longer necessary for the original purpose.
Right to Restrict Processing: The right to suspend or restrict processing activities under specific conditions.
Right to Object to Processing: The right to object to the use of personal data for certain purposes, such as direct marketing.

Data Controllers must be transparent about their data collection and processing activities, obtain valid consent from data subjects when necessary, and ensure that they have a process in place for handling data subject requests.

By providing data subjects with these rights, regulations like GDPR promote trust, accountability, and compliance in the management of personal data.

## Data sovereignty

Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data is under the jurisdiction of a specific country or organization, and that it has control over its collection, storage, processing, and usage within that domain.

Data Location: The location where data is physically stored or processed can be seen as a critical factor in determining data sovereignty. Data stored outside of a country or region may be subject to different laws, regulations, or surveillance practices.
Jurisdictional Boundaries: Countries and organizations have the right to regulate and oversee data collection and processing activities that occur within their boundaries, including online interactions and data transmissions.
Data Ownership and Custodianship: Data sovereignty raises questions about who has ownership and control over data, and what obligations they have regarding its protection and security.

## Biometrics

Biometrics refers to the unique physical and behavioral characteristics used for identification or verification purposes. The rise of biometric technology has raised significant concerns about data privacy, security, and ethics.

Data Concerns Associated with Biometrics:
Privacy: Biometric data is sensitive and personal, raising concerns about its collection, storage, and use without individual consent.
Security: Biometric data can be used for identity theft, impersonation, and other malicious activities if not properly secured and protected.
Data Brokering: Biometric data can be shared or sold to third parties without user consent, creating a significant risk to privacy and security.
Error Rates: Biometric systems are prone to error rates, which can lead to inaccurate matches or false positives/negatives.
Data Minimization: Excessive collection and storage of biometric data can lead to data sprawl, increasing the attack surface for cyber threats.
Biases: Biometric systems may incorporate biases in their design, collection, or analysis, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
Transparency and Consent: Users may not fully understand how their biometric data is being collected, used, or shared without proper transparency and consent.
