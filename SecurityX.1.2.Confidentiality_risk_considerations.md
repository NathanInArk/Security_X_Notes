Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

## Data leak response

A data leak is an unauthorized release or exposure of sensitive information. A data leak response plan outlines the steps to contain and mitigate the damage caused by such a breach.

Steps:

* Detection: Identify the leak and assess its scope
* Containment: Limit access and prevent further dissemination
* Eradication: Remove the source of the leak
* Recovery: Restore systems and data to a secure state
* Remediation: Implement additional security measures to prevent future breaches

## Sensitive/privileged data breach

A sensitive or privileged data breach occurs when unauthorized individuals gain access to confidential information. This can include intellectual property, personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive data.

Consequences:

* Financial loss and reputation damage
* Legal action and regulatory fines
* Loss of customer trust and loyalty

Mitigation strategies:

* Implement access controls  (e.g., authentication, authorization)
* Limit data sharing and dissemination
* Regularly audit and monitor system activity

## Incident response testing

Testing helps identify weaknesses in the incident response process, allowing for targeted improvements before an actual incident occurs. Types of tests:

* Table-top exercises: Walk-through simulations with key personnel
* Simulation exercises: Realistic scenarios with mock victims and scenarios
* Red teaming: Cyber-attacks or phishing attempts against internal systems

## Reporting

 reporting refers to the process of providing insights and information about an organization's security posture to stakeholders.

Types of Reports:

* **Status Reports**: Updates on current incidents, risks, and compliance status. Example: A monthly report outlining the number of security breaches, risk assessment findings, and compliance certifications
* **Incident Reports**: Detailed descriptions of security breaches or other significant events. Example: An incident report detailing a data breach, including root cause analysis, impact, and remediation efforts
* **Risk Reports**: Analyzes potential risks to an organization's assets, systems, or operations. Example: A risk report identifying the top five risks facing a financial institution, including mitigation strategies and recommendations

Effective reporting in GRC helps organizations: Identify areas of improvement. Demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. Communicate security posture to stakeholders (board members, executives, customers)

## Encryption

Encryption protects sensitive information by securing data at rest, which is when the data is stored on a device. Data in use, when it is being processed. Data in transit, when data is being transmitted across a network.
