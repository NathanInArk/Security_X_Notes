Governance, Risk, and Compliance

1.3 Explain how compliance affects information security strategies.

A security certifications is provided to the company after audits and asseements from most of the time, a third party. Some common ones are ISO, 27001/27701, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS, HITRUST, SOC, FedRAMP which is required by law for federal systems.

SOC has three levels, with two sub levels. A SOC 1 focuses mostly on financial controls. SOC 2 has a type 1 and a type 2. Type 1 focuses on design controls suitability and effectiveness and is a point in time. SOC 2 type 2 focuses on the same thing, but over a period of six months or a year. SOC 2 report include details of how things are handled, and often require the viewer to sign and NDA before they can read them. SOC 3 is a less in depth version of SOC2 suitable for public release, It does not goes into details, but rather provide the high level controls for public consumption.

I would recommend that you read a bit into each of the assessments and certifications. 

## External

An external audit is an audit preformed by a third company, this can be due to statutory requirements. The auditors will provide their opinion on where the security controls, processes and documentations are acceptable with the regulator requirements. An external auditor is often a 3rd party or company that is not controlled by the organization that it is auditing.

## Internal

An internal audit is one conducted by the company to improve the organizations operations. After the audit, recommendations should be provided. The team doing the audit should be independent so there is un-bias reporting of issues.
