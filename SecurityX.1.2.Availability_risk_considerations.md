Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

To get started lets make sure we understand the terminology around risk.
An Asset is an item of value to the organization, including stuff as data, hardware, software, or physical property. 
A Risk is the probability or likelihood of a threat.
A vulnerability is a weakness in hardware or software, that may be exploited.
A threat is anything that can cause harm, loss, damage or comprise an asset. 
Motivation is the reason why an activity is happening, for example a hacktivist might attack the network due to the company having opposing political views.
The source of a risk, can be internal or external, and internal risk is anything from inside the company and an external is anything outside of the company including hackers and natural disasters.
