Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, implement the
appropriate governance components.

## Production

This is where the final product is live and running. Here you should focus on ensuring that security controls are in place, monitoring and incident response procedures are established, and compliance with regulatory requirements is maintained.

## Development

The development environment should be set up to mirror the production environment. THis is where you will build before you deploy. Here you want to focus on secure coding practices, vulnerability management. Implementation of encryption, hashing and secure protocols. This is also a great area to conduct risk assessments and threat modeling with out impacting the production services. Everyone has a development environment, some people are lucky enough to have it be separate from your production systems.

## Testing

Testing is essential to ensure that security controls and vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated, this can include security testing and penetration testing. VUlnerability assessment and remediation. Configuration auditing and compliance validation.

## Quality assurance (QA)

QA focuses on verifying that systems mee the required standards and comply with organization policies, regulations and any laws. QA ensure that security controls are properly implemented and tested.

## Data life cycle management

The data life cycle management focuses on managing sensitive information from creation to destruction. The five phase approach is collection the data(classification and apply labels here), storing and maintain the data, processing the data, sharing and using the data, and deleting and archived the data.

Data should be collected for the reason specified, and used only for that. Data should be encrypted and all that good stuff. Data should be shared with only those who need access. Data should be securely destroyed at the end.
