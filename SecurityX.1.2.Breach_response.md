Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

In a perfect world all breaches and incident will end with a lessons learned or after-action review. The purpose of these is to provide insights and recommendations for when these processes are repeated. Some things worth reviewing are:

- Policies and procedures
- Technology, configuration or system enhancements
- Personal resources including response team resources
- Communication procedures
- training
- the security measures put in place
- whether enough information was available to resolve the incident
- Whether the procedures outlined in the response plan were adequate and worked as intended.

Before you have a live incident, it's best to get your feet wet with some testing. Testing comes in five catagories. A Walk-Through is one of the least disruptive ways to test, you get everyone together and they walk though what actions they would take to respond to and incident. The easiest form of testing a checklist test. Y'all just read though the checklist of procedures to help determine gaps or concerns to further analyze. The tabletop exercise is closer to a real incident but combines the previous ones and allows for more discussions about the incident response. Parallel Test are when the team runs through the steps along side the disaster recovery systems and processes. This is often group with a Simulation test, in which the team goes though all of the steps, but the production system stays running. A full interruption test is the holy grail of testing, you preform a simulated disaster by downing something and testing the response of your disaster/incident recovery plan.
