Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

In a perfect world all breaches and incident will end with a lessons learned or after-action review. The purpose of these is to provide insights and recommendations for when these processes are repeated. Some things worth reviewing are:

- Policies and procedures
- Technology, configuration or system enhancements
- Personal resources including response team resources
- Communication procedures
- training
- the security measures put in place
- whether enough information was available to resolve the incident
- Whether the procedures outlined in the response plan were adequate and worked as intended.
