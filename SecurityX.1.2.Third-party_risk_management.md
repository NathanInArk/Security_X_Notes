Governance, Risk, and Compliance

Given a set of organizational security requirements, perform risk
management activities.

## Supply chain risk

Supply Chain Risk refers to the potential disruptions or threats that may arise during the movement of goods, services, or information from one organization to another. This can include physical transportation risks, information security risks, financial risks, regulatory compliance risks, and reputational risks.

## Vendor risk

Vendor Risk refers to the potential risks associated with vendors, including their ability to deliver quality products or services, manage information security, protect intellectual property, comply with regulations, and maintain transparency. These risks can have significant financial, operational, or reputational consequences if not managed effectively.

## Subprocessor risk

A Subprocessor is an entity that is contracted by another party to process data or perform certain functions as part of the broader outsourcing arrangement. The risk associated with Subprocessors lies in the potential for data breaches, loss of control, or compliance issues, which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.
