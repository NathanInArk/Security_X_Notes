4.0 Security Operations

Given a scenario, analyze data to enable monitoring and response activities.

Gathering metrics is not the hard part, the hard part is understanding what the metrics represent and their impact. Once valid metrics are understood you can create key performance indications (KPIs), and key risk indicators (KRI). Metrics answer what are we doing, KPI answers How are we doing, and KRI answers how careful must we be.

Some good metrics and other things to understand are the following.

- Performance is measured against a known preset of standards of accuracy, completeness, cost and speed.
- Uptime Agreements, Service level agreement, pretty straight forward how much downtime is acceptable.
- Time Service Factor, percentage of help desk or response calls answered with in a given time frame,
- Abandon Rate, AR, number of callers who hang up while waiting for someone to answer
- First Call Resolution, FCR, number of resolutions that are made on the first call.
- Latency, delay in how long it takes something to response.
- Scalability, how well does the current program, network or application work as scale, volume or throughput is changed.
- Capability, ability to meet a goal
- Usability, extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals
- Security Requirements, self explanatory, the intersection between usability and security requirements is the trade off, trade off analysis might be used to find out if both are satisfied.
- Recoverability, Capability to restore systems to an exact point in time at which a failure occurred
- Maintainability, How well something can be kept up going forward.
- Availability, function state of a system and or the uptime, part of this is meat time between failure, MTBF and mean time to recovery, MTTR

## Visualization

Data is easier for humans to digest when you provide it in a visualization. This can be as simple as a graph, or something more complex like a dashboard.

## Dashboards

Dashboards are a collection of visualizations, often updated in real time or near real time. It can serve as a single pane of glass when it comes to metrics reporting.
